# Command Line Tooling Overview

## Overview

ast-grep's tooling supports multiple stages of your development. Here is a list of the tools and their purpose:

* To run an ad-hoc query and apply rewrite: `ast-grep run`.
* Routinely check your codebase: `ast-grep scan`.
* Generate ast-grep's scaffolding files: `ast-grep new`.
* Develop new ast-grep rules and test them: `ast-grep test`.
* Start Language Server for editor integration: `ast-grep lsp`.

We will walk through some important features that are common to these commands.

## Interactive Mode

ast-grep by default will output the results of your query at once in your terminal which is useful to have a quick glance at the result. But sometimes you will need to scrutinize every result one by one to refine you pattern query or to avoid bad cases for edge-case code.

You can use the `--interactive` flag to open an interactive mode. This will allow you to select which results you want to apply the rewrite to. This mode is inspired by [fast-mod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod).

Pressing `y` will accept the rewrite, `n` will skip it, `e` will open the file in your editor, and `q` will quit the interactive mode.

Example:

```bash
ast-grep scan --interactive
```

## JSON Mode

Composability is a key perk of command line tooling. ast-grep is no exception.

`--json` will output results in JSON format. This is useful to pipe the results to other tools. For example, you can use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to extract information from the results and render it in [jless](https://jless.io/).

```bash
ast-grep run -p 'Some($A)' -r 'None' --json | jq '.[].replacement' | jless
```

The format of the JSON output is an array of match objects.

```json
[
  {
    "text": "import",
    "range": {
      "byteOffset": {
        "start": 66,
        "end": 72
      },
      "start": {
        "line": 3,
        "column": 2
      },
      "end": {
        "line": 3,
        "column": 8
      }
    },
    "file": "website/src/vite-env.d.ts",
    "replacement": "require",
    "language": "TypeScript"
  }
]
```

See [JSON mode doc](/guide/tools/json.html) for more detailed explanation and examples.

## Run One Single Query or One Single Rule

You can also use ast-grep to explore a proper pattern for your query. There are two ways to try your pattern or rule.
For testing one pattern, you can use `ast-grep run` command.

```bash
ast-grep run -p 'YOUR_PATTERN' --debug-query
```

The `--debug-query` option will output the tree-sitter ast of the query.

To test one single rule, you can use `ast-grep scan -r`.

```bash
ast-grep scan -r path/to/your/rule.yml
```
It is useful to test one rule in isolation.

## Parse Code from StdIn

ast-grep's `run` and `scan` commands also support searching and replacing code from [standard input (StdIn)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Standard_streams).
This mode is enabled by passing command line argument flag `--stdin`.
You can use bash's [pipe operator](https://linuxhint.com/bash_pipe_tutorial/) `|` to instruct ast-grep to read from StdIn.

### Example: Simple Web Crawler

Let's see an example in action. Combining with `curl`, `ast-grep` and `jq`, we can build a [simple web crawler](https://twitter.com/trevmanz/status/1671572111582978049) on command line. The command below uses `curl` to fetch the HTML source of SciPy conference website, and then uses `ast-grep` to parse and extract relevant information as JSON from source, and finally uses `jq` to transform our matching results.

```bash
curl -s https://schedule2021.scipy.org/2022/conference/  |
  ast-grep -p '<div $$$> $$$ <i>$AUTHORS</i> </div>' --lang html --json --stdin |
  jq '
    .[]
    | .metaVariables
    | .single.AUTHORS.text'
```

The command above will produce a list of authors from the SciPy 2022 conference website.

:::details JSON output of the author list
```json
"Ben Blaiszik"
"Qiming Sun"
"Max Jones"
"Thomas J. Fan"
"Sebastian Bichelmaier"
"Cliff Kerr"
...
```
:::

With this feature, even if your preferred language does not have native bindings for ast-grep, you can still parse code from standard input (StdIn) to use ast-grep programmatically from the command line.

You can invoke `ast-grep`, the command-line interface binary, as a subprocess to search and replace code.

### Caveats

**StdIn mode has several restrictions**, though:

* It conflicts with `--interactive` mode, which reads user responses from StdIn.
* For the `run` command, you must specify the language of the StdIn code with `--lang` or `-l` flag. For example: `echo "print('Hello world')" | ast-grep run --lang python`. This is because ast-grep cannot infer code language without file extension.
* Similarly, you can only `scan` StdIn code against _one single rule_, specified by `--rule` or `-r` flag. The rule must match the language of the StdIn code. For example: `echo "print('Hello world')" | ast-grep scan --rule "python-rule.yml"`

### Enable StdIn Mode

**All the following conditions** must be met to enable StdIn mode:

1. The command line argument flag `--stdin` is passed.
2. ast-grep is **NOT** running inside a [tty](https://github.com/softprops/atty). If you are using a terminal emulator, ast-grep will usually run in a tty if invoked directly from CLI.

The first condition is quite self explanatory. However, it should be noted that many cases are not tty, for example:

* ast-grep is invoked by other program as subprocess.
* ast-grep is running inside [GitHub Action](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/241).
* ast-grep is used as the second program of a bash pipe `|`.

So you have to use `--stdin` to avoid unintentional StdIn mode and unexpected error.

:::danger Running ast-grep in tty with --stdin
ast-grep will hang there if you run it in a tty terminal session with `--stdin` flag, until you type in some text and send EOF signal (usually `Ctrl-D`).

#### Bonus Example

Here is a bonus example to use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#using-fzf-as-interactive-ripgrep-launcher) as interactive ast-grep launcher.

```bash
SG_PREFIX="ast-grep run --color=always -p "
INITIAL_QUERY="${*:-}"
: | fzf --ansi --disabled --query "$INITIAL_QUERY" \
    --bind "start:reload:$SG_PREFIX {q}" \
    --bind "change:reload:sleep 0.1; $SG_PREFIX {q} || true" \
    --delimiter : \
    --preview 'bat --color=always {1} --highlight-line {2}' \
    --preview-window 'up,60%,border-bottom,+{2}+3/3,~3' \
    --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'
```

## Editor Integration

See the [editor integration](/guide/tools/editors.md) doc page.

## Shell Completions
ast-grep comes with shell autocompletion scripts. You can generate a shell script and eval it when your shell starts up.
The script will enable you to smoothly complete `ast-grep` command's options by `tab`bing.

This command will instruct ast-grep  to generate shell completion script:

```shell
ast-grep completions <SHELL>
```

`<SHELL>` is an optional argument and can be one of the `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell` and `zsh`. If shell is not specified, ast-grep will infer the correct shell from environment variable like `$SHELL`.

The exact steps required to enable autocompletion will vary by shell. For instructions, see the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) or [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#complete) documentation.

### Example

If you are using zsh, add this line to your `~/.zshrc`.

```shell
eval "$(ast-grep completions)"
```

## Use ast-grep in GitHub Action

If you want to automate [ast-grep linting](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ast-grep-gh-action) in your repository, you can use [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions), a feature that lets you create custom workflows for different events.

For example, you can run ast-grep linting every time you push a new commit to your main branch.

To use ast-grep in GitHub Action, you need to [set up a project](/guide/scan-project.html) first. You can do this by running `ast-grep new` in your terminal, which will guide you through the process of creating a configuration file and a rules file.

Next, you need to create a workflow file for GitHub Action. This is a YAML file that defines the steps and actions that will be executed when a certain event occurs. You can create a workflow file named `ast-grep.yml` under the `.github/workflows/` folder in your repository, with the following content:

```yml
on: [push]

jobs:
  sg-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run ast-grep lint
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: ast-grep lint step
        uses: ast-grep/action@v1.4
```

This workflow file tells GitHub Action to run ast-grep linting on every push event, using the latest Ubuntu image and the official ast-grep action.
The action will check out your code and run [`ast-grep scan`](/reference/cli.html#ast-grep-scan) on it, reporting any errors or warnings.

That's it! You have successfully set up ast-grep linting in GitHub Action. Now, every time you push a new commit to your main branch, GitHub Action will automatically run ast-grep linting and show you the results. You can see an example of how it looks like below.

![image](https://github.com/ast-grep/action/assets/2883231/52fe5914-5e43-4478-a7b2-fb0399f61dee)

For more information, you can refer to the [ast-grep/action](https://github.com/ast-grep/action) repository, where you can find more details and options for using ast-grep in GitHub Action.

## Colorful Output

The output of ast-grep is exuberant and beautiful! But it is not always desired for colorful output.
You can use `--color never` to disable ANSI color in the command line output.
