# Editor Integration

ast-grep is a **command line tool** for structural search/replace. But it can be readily integrated into your editors and streamline your workflow.

This page introduces several **editors** that has ast-grep support.

## VSCode

ast-grep has an official [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ast-grep.ast-grep-vscode#overview) in the market place.

To get a feel of what it can do, see the introduction on YouTube!

### Features

The ast-grep VSCode is an extension to bridge the power of ast-grep and the beloved editor VSCode.
It includes two parts:

* a UI for ast-grep CLI and
* a client for ast-grep LSP.

:::tip Requirement
You need to [install ast-grep CLI](/guide/quick-start.html#installation) locally and optionally [set up a linting project](/guide/scan-project.html).

### Structural Search

Use [pattern](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/pattern-syntax.html) to structural search your codebase.

### Structural Replace

Use pattern to [replace](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/rewrite-code.html) matching code.

### Diagnostics and Code Action

*Require LSP setup*

Code linting and code actions require [setting up `sgconfig.yml`](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/scan-project.html) in your workspace root.

### FAQs

<br/>

#### Why LSP diagnostics are not working?

You need several things to set up LSP diagnostics:
1. [Install](/guide/quick-start.html#installation) ast-grep CLI. Make sure it is accessible in VSCode editor.
2. [Set up a linting project](/guide/scan-project.html) in your workspace root. The `sgconfig.yml` file is required for LSP diagnostics.
3. The LSP server by default is started in the workspace root. Make sure the `sgconfig.yml` is in the workspace root.


#### Why ast-grep VSCode cannot find the CLI?

The extension has a different environment from the terminal. You need to make sure the CLI is accessible in the extension environment. For example, if the CLI is installed in a virtual environment, you need to activate the virtual environment in the terminal where you start VSCode.

Here are a few ways to make the CLI accessible:

1. Install the CLI globally.
2. Specify the CLI path in the extension settings `astGrep.serverPath`.
3. Check if VSCode has the same `PATH` as the terminal.

#### Project Root Detection
By default, ast-grep will only start in the workspace root. If you want to start ast-grep in a subfolder, you can specify the `configPath` in the extension settings.
The `configPath` is the path to the `sgconfig.yml` file and is relative to the workspace root.

#### Schema Validation
When writing your own `rule.yml` file, you can use schema validation to get quick feedback on whether your file is structured properly.
1. Add the following line to the top of your file:
```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/main/schemas/rule.json
```
2. Install a VSCode extension that supports schema validation for yaml files. For example, [YAML by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

![Schema Validation](/image/schema-validation.png)
After reloading the VSCode window, you should see red underlines for any errors in your `rule.yml` file, along with autocompletions and tooltips on hover. In VSCode you can typically use [Ctrl] + [Space] to see the available autocompletions.

## Neovim

### nvim-lspconfig

The recommended setup is using [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).

```lua
require('lspconfig').ast_grep.setup({
  -- these are the default options, you only need to specify
  -- options you'd like to change from the default
  cmd = { 'ast-grep', 'lsp' },
  filetypes = { "c", "cpp", "rust", "go", "java", "python", "javascript", "typescript", "html", "css", "kotlin", "dart", "lua" },
  root_dir = require('lspconfig.util').root_pattern('sgconfig.yaml', 'sgconfig.yml')
})
```

### coc.nvim

Please see [coc-ast-grep](https://github.com/yaegassy/coc-ast-grep)

You need to have coc.nvim installed for this extension to work. e.g. vim-plug:

```vim
Plug 'yaegassy/coc-ast-grep', {'do': 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'}
```

### telescope.nvim

[telescope-sg](https://github.com/Marskey/telescope-sg) is the ast-grep picker for telescope.nvim.

Usage:

```vim
Telescope ast_grep
```

[telescope-ast-grep.nvim](https://github.com/ray-x/telescope-ast-grep.nvim) is an alternative plugin that provides ast-grep functionality enhancements.

### grug-far.nvim

[grug-far.nvim](https://github.com/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim) has ast-grep search engine support. It allows for both live searching as you type and replacing.

Usage:

```vim
:lua require('grug-far').grug_far({ engine = 'astgrep' })
```
or swap to `astgrep` engine while running with the `Swap Engine` action.

## Emacs

### ast-grep.el
[ast-grep.el](https://github.com/SunskyXH/ast-grep.el) is an emacs package for searching code using ast-grep with completing-read interface or consult.

You can install via `straight.el`

```elisp
(straight-use-package '(ast-grep :type git :host github :repo "SunskyXH/ast-grep.el"))
```

Or if you are using doomemacs, add to your `packages.el`

```elisp
(package! ast-grep :recipe (:host github :repo "SunskyXH/ast-grep.el"))
```

## LSP Server

Currently ast-grep support these LSP capabilities:

### Server capability

* [publish diagnostics](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_publishDiagnostics)
* [Fix diagnostic code action](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_publishCodeAction)

### Client requirements

* [textDocument/didOpen](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didOpen)
* [textDocument/didChange](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didChange)
* [textDocument/didClose](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didClose)

### Configuration

ast-grep does not have LSP configuration, except that ast-grep LSP requires `sgconfig.yml` in the project root.

You can also specify the configuration file path via command line:

```bash
ast-grep lsp -c <configPath>
```
