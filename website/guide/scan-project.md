# Scan Your Project!

Let's explore its power to run scan on your code repository in a scalable way!

`ast-grep scan` is the command you can use to run multiple rules against your repository so that you don't need to pass pattern query to your command line every time.

However, to ast-grep's scan need some scaffolding for project setup. We will walk through the process in this guide.

:::tip
`ast-grep scan` requires at least one file and one directory to work:
* `sgconfig.yml`, the [project configuration](/reference/sgconfig.html) file
* a directory storing rule files, usually `rules/`
:::

## Create Scaffolding

To set up ast-grep's scanning, you can simply run the command `ast-grep new` in the root directory of your repository. You will be guided with a series of interactive questions, like the following:

```markdown
No sgconfig.yml found. Creating a new ast-grep project...
> Where do you want to have your rules? rules
> Do you want to create rule tests? Yes
> Where do you want to have your tests? rule-tests
> Do you want to create folder for utility rules? Yes
> Where do you want to have your utilities? utils
Your new ast-grep project has been created!
```

After you answering these questions, you will get a folder structure like the below.

```bash
my-awesome-project
  |- rules           # where rules go
  |- rule-tests       # test cases for rules
  |- utils           # global utility rules for reusing
  |- sgconfig.yml    # root configuration file
```

## Create the Rule

Now you can start creating a rule! Continue using `ast-grep new`, it will ask you what to create. But you can also use `ast-grep new rule` to create a rule directly!

You will be asked several questions about the rule going to be created. Suppose we want to create a rule to ensure no eval in JavaScript.

```markdown
> What is your rule's name? no-eval
> Choose rule's language JavaScript
Created rules at ./rules/no-eval.yml
> Do you also need to create a test for the rule? Yes
Created test at rule-tests/no-eval-test.yml
```

Now you can see open the new rule created in the `rules/no-eval.yml`. File path might vary depending on your choice on the first step.

> `no-eval.yml`

```yml
id: no-eval
message: Add your rule message here....
severity: error # error, warning, hint, info
language: JavaScript
rule:
  pattern: Your Rule Pattern here...
# utils: Extract repeated rule as local utility here.
# note: Add detailed explanation for the rule.
```

We will go through the rule config in the next chapter. But these configurations are quite obvious and self explaining.

Let's change the `pattern` inside `rule` and change the rule's message.

```yml
id: no-eval
message: Add your rule message here.... // [!code --]
message: Do not use eval! Dangerous! Hazardous! Perilous! // [!code ++]
severity: error
language: JavaScript
rule:
  pattern: Your Rule Pattern here... // [!code --]
  pattern: eval($CODE) // [!code ++]
```

Okay! The pattern syntax works just like what we have learnt before.

## Scan the Code

Now you can try scanning the code! You can create a JavaScript file containing `eval` to test it.

Run `ast-grep scan` in your project, ast-grep will give you some beautiful scan report!

```bash
error[no-eval]: Add your rule message here....
  ┌─ test.js:1:1
  │
1 │ eval('hello')
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Error: 1 error(s) found in code.
Help: Scan succeeded and found error level diagnostics in the codebase.
```


## Summary

In this section we learnt how to set up ast-grep project, create new rules using cli tool and scan problems in the repository.

To summarize the commands we used:

* `ast-grep new` - Create a new ast-grep project
* `ast-grep new rule` - Create a new rule in a rule folder.
* `ast-grep scan` - Scan the codebase with the rules in the project.
