# Project Configuration

## Root Configuration File

ast-grep supports using [YAML](https://yaml.org/) to configure its linting rules to scan your code repository.
We need a root configuration file `sgconfig.yml` to specify directories where `sg` can find all rules.

In your project root, add `sgconfig.yml` with content as below.

```yaml
ruleDirs:
  - rules
```

This instructs ast-grep to use all files _recursively_ inside the `rules` folder as rule files.

For example, suppose we have the following file structures.

```
my-awesome-project
  |- rules
  | |- no-var.yml
  | |- no-bit-operation.yml
  | |- my_custom_rules
  |   |- custom-rule.yml
  |   |- fancy-rule.yml
  |- sgconfig.yml
  |- not-a-rule.yml
```

All the YAML files under `rules` folder will be treated as rule files by `sg`, while`not-a-rule.yml` is ignored by ast-grep.


**Note, the [`sg scan`](/reference/cli.html#scan) command requires you have an `sgconfig.yml` in your project root.**

:::tip Pro tip
We can also use directories in `node_modules` to reuse preconfigured rules published on npm!

More broadly speaking, any git hosted projects can be imported as rule sets by using [`git submodule`](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
