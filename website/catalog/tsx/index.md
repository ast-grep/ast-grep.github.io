# TSX

This page curates a list of example ast-grep rules to check and to rewrite TypeScript with JSX syntax.

:::danger TSX and TypeScript are different.
TSX differs from TypeScript because it is an extension of the latter that supports JSX elements.
They need distinct parsers because of [conflicting syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#the-as-operator).

In order to reduce rule duplication, you can use the [`languageGlobs`](/reference/sgconfig.html#languageglobs) option to force ast-grep to use parse `.ts` files as TSX.
