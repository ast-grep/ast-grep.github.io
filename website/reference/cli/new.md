# `ast-grep new`

Create new ast-grep project or items like rules/tests. Also see the step by step [guide](/guide/scan-project.html).

## Usage

```shell
ast-grep new [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [NAME]
```

## Commands

### `project`

Create an new project by scaffolding.

By default, this command will create a root config file `sgconfig.yml`,
a rule folder `rules`, a test case folder `rule-tests` and a utility rule folder `utils`.
You can customize the folder names during the creation.


### `rule`

Create a new rule.

This command will create a new rule in one of the `rule_dirs`.
You need to provide `name` and `language` either by interactive input or via command line arguments.
ast-grep will ask you which `rule_dir` to use if multiple ones are configured in the `sgconfig.yml`.
If `-y, --yes` flag is true, ast-grep will choose the first `rule_dir` to create the new rule.

### `test`

Create a new test case.

This command will create a new test in one of the `test_dirs`.
You need to provide `name` either by interactive input or via command line arguments.
ast-grep will ask you which `test_dir` to use if multiple ones are configured in the `sgconfig.yml`.
If `-y, --yes` flag is true, ast-grep will choose the first `test_dir` to create the new test.

### `util`
Create a new global utility rule.

This command will create a new global utility rule in one of the `utils` folders.
You need to provide `name` and `language` either by interactive input or via command line arguments.
ast-grep will ask you which `util_dir` to use if multiple ones are configured in the `sgconfig.yml`.
If `-y, --yes` flag is true, ast-grep will choose the first `util_dir` to create the new item.
