# `ast-grep run`

Run one time search or rewrite in command line.
This is the default command when you run the CLI, so `ast-grep -p 'foo()'` is equivalent to `ast-grep run -p 'foo()'`.

## Usage

```shell
ast-grep run [OPTIONS] --pattern <PATTERN> [PATHS]...
```

## Arguments

`[PATHS]...`

The paths to search. You can provide multiple paths separated by spaces

[default: `.`]


## Run Specific Options

### `-p, --pattern <PATTERN>`

AST pattern to match

### `-r, --rewrite <FIX>`

String to replace the matched AST node

### `-l, --lang <LANG>`

The language of the pattern. For full language list, visit https://ast-grep.github.io/reference/languages.html

### `--debug-query[=<format>]`

Print query pattern's tree-sitter AST. Requires lang be set explicitly.

Possible values:
- **pattern**: Print the query parsed in Pattern format
- **ast**: Print the query in tree-sitter AST format, only named nodes are shown
- **cst**: Print the query in tree-sitter CST format, both named and unnamed nodes are shown
- **sexp**: Print the query in S-expression format

#### `--selector <KIND>`

AST kind to extract sub-part of pattern to match.

selector defines the sub-syntax node kind that is the actual matcher of the pattern. See https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/rule-config/atomic-rule.html#pattern-object.

### `--strictness <STRICTNESS>`

The strictness of the pattern. More strict algorithm will match less code. See [match algorithm deep dive](/advanced/match-algorithm.html) for more details.

Possible values:
- **cst**:       Match exact all node
- **smart**:     Match all node except source trivial nodes
- **ast**:       Match only ast nodes
- **relaxed**:   Match ast node except comments
- **signature**: Match ast node except comments, without text

[default: smart]

## Input Options

### `--no-ignore <FILE_TYPE>`

Do not respect hidden file system or ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.).

You can suppress multiple ignore files by passing `no-ignore` multiple times.

Possible values:
- **hidden**:  Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories are skipped
- **dot**:     Don't respect .ignore files. This does *not* affect whether ast-grep will ignore files and directories whose names begin with a dot. For that, use --no-ignore hidden
- **exclude**: Don't respect ignore files that are manually configured for the repository such as git's '.git/info/exclude'
- **global**:  Don't respect ignore files that come from "global" sources such as git's `core.excludesFile` configuration option (which defaults to `$HOME/.config/git/ignore`)
- **parent**:  Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) in parent directories
- **vcs**:     Don't respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.). This implies --no-ignore parent for VCS files. Note that .ignore files will continue to be respected

### `--stdin`

Enable search code from StdIn.

Use this if you need to take code stream from standard input.

### `--globs <GLOBS>`

Include or exclude file paths.

Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a `!` to exclude it. If multiple globs match a file or directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence.

### `--follow`

Follow symbolic links.

This flag instructs ast-grep to follow symbolic links while traversing directories. This behavior is disabled by default. Note that ast-grep will check for symbolic link loops and report errors if it finds one. ast-grep will also report errors for broken links.

## Output Options

### `-i, --interactive`

Start interactive edit session.

You can confirm the code change and apply it to files selectively, or you can open text editor to tweak the matched code. Note that code rewrite only happens inside a session.

### `-j, --threads <NUM>`

Set the approximate number of threads to use.

This flag sets the approximate number of threads to use. A value of 0 (which is the default) causes ast-grep to choose the thread count using heuristics.

[default: 0]

### `-U, --update-all`

Apply all rewrite without confirmation if true

### `--json[=<STYLE>]`
Output matches in structured JSON .

If this flag is set, ast-grep will output matches in JSON format. You can pass optional value to this flag by using `--json=<STYLE>` syntax to further control how JSON object is formatted and printed. ast-grep will `pretty`-print JSON if no value is passed. Note, the json flag must use `=` to specify its value. It conflicts with interactive.

Possible values:
- **pretty**:  Prints the matches as a pretty-printed JSON array, with indentation and line breaks. This is useful for human readability, but not for parsing by other programs. This is the default value for the `--json` option
- **stream**:  Prints each match as a separate JSON object, followed by a newline character. This is useful for streaming the output to other programs that can read one object per line
- **compact**: Prints the matches as a single-line JSON array, without any whitespace. This is useful for saving space and minimizing the output size

### `--color <WHEN>`
Controls output color.

This flag controls when to use colors. The default setting is 'auto', which means ast-grep will try to guess when to use colors. If ast-grep is printing to a terminal, then it will use colors, but if it is redirected to a file or a pipe, then it will suppress color output. ast-grep will also suppress color output in some other circumstances. For example, no color will be used if the TERM environment variable is not set or set to 'dumb'.

[default: auto]

Possible values:
- **auto**:   Try to use colors, but don't force the issue. If the output is piped to another program, or the console isn't available on Windows, or if TERM=dumb, or if `NO_COLOR` is defined, for example, then don't use colors
- **always**: Try very hard to emit colors. This includes emitting ANSI colors on Windows if the console API is unavailable (not implemented yet)
- **ansi**:   Ansi is like Always, except it never tries to use anything other than emitting ANSI color codes
- **never**:  Never emit colors

### `--heading <WHEN>`

Controls whether to print the file name as heading.

If heading is used, the file name will be printed as heading before all matches of that file. If heading is not used, ast-grep will print the file path before each match as prefix. The default value `auto` is to use heading when printing to a terminal and to disable heading when piping to another program or redirected to files.

[default: auto]

Possible values:
- **auto**:   Print heading for terminal tty but not for piped output
- **always**: Always print heading regardless of output type
- **never**:  Never print heading regardless of output type

### `--inspect <GRANULARITY>`
Inspect information for file/rule discovery and scanning.

This flag helps user to observe ast-grep's internal filtering of files and rules. Inspection will output how many and why files and rules are scanned and skipped. Inspection outputs to stderr and does not affect the result of the search.

The format of the output is informally defined as follows:

```
sg: <GRANULARITY>|<ENTITY_TYPE>|<ENTITY_IDENTIFIERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMA>: KEY=VAL
```

The [Extended Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) notation is specified in the [issue](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/issues/1574).

[default: nothing]

Possible values:
- **nothing**: Do not show any tracing information
- **summary**: Show summary about how many files are scanned and skipped
- **entity**:  Show per-file/per-rule tracing information

## Context Options

### `-A, --after <NUM>`
Show NUM lines after each match.

It conflicts with both the -C/--context flag.

[default: 0]

### `-B, --before <NUM>`
Show NUM lines before each match.

It conflicts with both the -C/--context flag.

[default: 0]

### `-C, --context <NUM>`
Show NUM lines around each match.

This is equivalent to providing both the -B/--before and -A/--after flags with the same value. It conflicts with both the -B/--before and -A/--after flags.

[default: 0]

### `-h, --help`
Print help (see a summary with '-h')
