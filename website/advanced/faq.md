# Frequently Asked Questions

## My pattern does not work, why?

1. **Use the Playground**: Test your pattern in the [ast-grep playground](/playground.html).
2. **Check for Valid Code**: Make sure your pattern is valid code that tree-sitter can parse.
3. **Ensure Correctness**: Use a [pattern object](/guide/rule-config/atomic-rule.html#pattern) to ensure your code is correct and unambiguous.
4. **Explore Examples**: See ast-grep's [catalog](/catalog/) for more examples.


The most common scenario is that you only want to match a sub-expression or one specific AST node in a whole syntax tree.
However, the code fragment corresponding to the sub-expression may not be valid code.
To make the code can be parsed by tree-sitter, you probably need more context instead of providing just code fragment.

For example, if you want to match key-value pair in JSON, writing `"key": "$VAL"` will not work because it is not a legal JSON.

Instead, you can provide context via the pattern object. See [playground code](/playground.html#eyJtb2RlIjoiQ29uZmlnIiwibGFuZyI6Impzb24iLCJxdWVyeSI6ImZvbygkJCRBLCBiLCAkJCRDKSIsInJld3JpdGUiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOiJydWxlOlxuICBwYXR0ZXJuOiBcbiAgICBjb250ZXh0OiAne1widmVyc2lvblwiOiBcIiRWRVJcIiB9J1xuICAgIHNlbGVjdG9yOiBwYWlyIiwic291cmNlIjoie1xuICAgIFwidmVyc2lvblwiOiBcInZlclwiXG59In0=).

```YAML
rule:
  pattern:
    context: '{"key": "$VAL"}'
    selector: pair
```

The idea is that you can write full an valid code in the `context` field and use `selector` to select the sub-AST node.

This trick can be used in other languages as well, like [C](/catalog/c/#match-function-call) and [Go](/catalog/go/#match-function-call-in-golang). That said, pattern is not always the best choice for code search. [Rule](/guide/rule-config.html) can be more expressive and powerful.

## My Rule does not work, why?
Here are some tips to debug your rule:
* Use the [ast-grep playground](/playground.html) to test your rule.
* Simplify your rule to the minimal possible code that reproduces the issue.
* Confirm pattern's matched AST nodes are expected. e.g. statement and expression are [different matches](/advanced/pattern-parse.html#extract-effective-ast-for-pattern). This usually happens when you use `follows` or `precedes` in the rule.
* Check the [rule order](/advanced/faq.html#why-is-rule-matching-order-sensitive). The order of rules matters in ast-grep especially when using meta variables with relational rules.

## CLI and Playground produce different results, why?

There are two main reasons why the results may differ:

* **Parser Version**: The CLI may use a different version of the tree-sitter parser than the Playground.
Playground parsers are updated less frequently than the CLI, so there may be differences in the results.
* **Text Encoding**: The CLI and Playground use different text encodings. CLI uses utf-8, while the Playground uses utf-16.
The encoding difference may cause different fallback parsing during [error recovery](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/224).

To debug the issue, you can use the [`--debug-query`](/reference/cli/run.html#debug-query-format) in the CLI to see the parsed AST nodes and meta variables.

```sh
ast-grep run -p <PATTERN> --debug-query ast
```

The debug output will show the parsed AST nodes and you can compare them with the [Playground](/playground.html). You can also use different debug formats like `cst` or `pattern`.

Different results are usually caused by incomplete or wrong code snippet in the pattern. A common fix is to provide a complete context code via the [pattern object](/reference/rule.html#atomic-rules).

```yaml
rule:
  pattern:
    context: 'int main() { return 0; }'
    selector: function
```

See [Pattern Deep Dive](/advanced/pattern-parse.html) for more context. Alternatively, you can try [rule](/guide/rule-config.html) instead.

Note `--debug-query` is not only for pattern, you can pass source code as `pattern` to see the parsed AST.

:::details Text encoding impacts tree-sitter error recovery.
Tree-sitter is a robust parser that can recover from syntax errors and continue parsing the rest of the code.
The exact strategy for error recovery is implementation-defined and uses a heuristic to determine the best recovery strategy.
See [tree-sitter issue](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/224) for more details.

Text-encoding will affect the error recovery because it changed the cost of different recovery strategies.

## MetaVariable does not work, why?

1. **Correct Naming**: Start meta variables with the `$` sign, followed by uppercase letters (A-Z), underscores (`_`), or digits (1-9).
2. **Single AST Node**: A meta variable should be a single AST node. Avoid mixing meta variables with other text in one AST node. For example, `mix$OTHER_VAR` or `use$HOOK` will not work.
3. **Named AST Nodes**: By default, a meta variable matches only named AST nodes. Use double dollar signs like `$$UNNAMED` to match unnamed nodes.

## Multiple MetaVariable does not work

Multiple meta variables in ast-grep, such as `$$$MULTI`, are lazy. They stop matching nodes if the first node after them can match.

For example, `foo($$$A, b, $$$C)` matches `foo(a, c, b, b, c)`. `$$$A` stops before the first `b` and only matches `a, c`.

This design follows TypeScript's template literal types (`${infer VAR}Literal`) to ensure multiple meta variables always produce a match or non-match in linear time.

## Pattern cannot match my use case, how?

Patterns are a quick and easy way to match code in ast-grep, but they might not handle complex code. YAML rules are much more expressive and make it easier to specify complex code.

## I want to pattern match function call starts with some prefix string, how can I do that?

It is common to find function name or variable name following some naming convention like a function must starts with specific prefix.

For example, [React Hook](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#hook-names-always-start-with-use) in JavaScript requires function names start with `use`. Another example will be using `io_uring` in [Linux asynchronous programming](https://unixism.net/loti/genindex.html).

You may start with pattern like `use$HOOK` or `io_uring_$FUNC`. However, they are not valid meta variable names since the AST node text does not start with the dollar sign.

The workaround is using [`constraints`](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/project/lint-rule.html#constraints) in [YAML rule](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/project/lint-rule.html) and [`regex`](https://ast-grep.github.io/guide/rule-config/atomic-rule.html#regex) rule.

```yaml
rule:
  pattern: $HOOK($$$ARGS)
constraints:
  HOOK: { regex: '^use' }
```

:::danger MetaVariable must be one single AST node
Meta variables cannot be mixed with prefix/suffix string . `use$HOOK` and `io_uring_$FUNC` are not valid meta variables. They are parsed as one AST node as whole, and
ast-grep will not treat them as valid meta variable name.

## How to reuse rule for similar languages like TS/JS or C/C++?

ast-grep does not support multiple languages in one rule because:

1. **Different ASTs**: Similar languages still have different ASTs. For instance, [JS](/playground.html#eyJtb2RlIjoiUGF0Y2giLCJsYW5nIjoiamF2YXNjcmlwdCIsInF1ZXJ5IjoiIiwicmV3cml0ZSI6IiIsInN0cmljdG5lc3MiOiJyZWxheGVkIiwic2VsZWN0b3IiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOiIiLCJzb3VyY2UiOiJmdW5jdGlvbiB0ZXN0KGEpIHt9In0=) and [TS](#eyJtb2RlIjoiUGF0Y2giLCJsYW5nIjoidHlwZXNjcmlwdCIsInF1ZXJ5IjoiIiwicmV3cml0ZSI6IiIsInN0cmljdG5lc3MiOiJyZWxheGVkIiwic2VsZWN0b3IiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOiIiLCJzb3VyY2UiOiJmdW5jdGlvbiB0ZXN0KGEpIHt9In0=) have different parsing trees for the same function declaration code.
2. **Different Kinds**: Similar languages may have different AST node kinds. Since ast-grep reports non-existing kinds as errors, there is no straightforward way to report error for kind only existing in one language.
3. **Debugging Experience**: Mixing languages in one rule requires users to test the rule in both languages. This can be confusing and error-prone, especially when unexpected results occur.

Supporting multi-lang rule is a challenging task for both tool developers and users. Instead, we recommend two approaches:
* **Always use the superset language**: Rule reusing usually happens when one language is a superset of another, e.g., TS and JS. In this case, you can use [`languageGlobs`](/reference/sgconfig.html#languageglobs) to parse files in the superset language. This is more suitable if you don't need to distinguish between the two languages.
* **Write Separate Rules**: Generate separate rules for each language. This approach is suitable when you do need to handle the differences between the languages.

If you have a better, clearer and easier proposal to support multi-lang rule, please leave a comment under [this issue](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/issues/525).


## Why is rule matching order sensitive?

ast-grep's rule matching is a step-by-step process. It matches one atomic rule at a time, stores the matched meta-variable, and proceeds to the next rule until all rules are matched.

**Rule matching is ordered** because previous rules' matched meta-variables can affect later rules. Only the first rule can specify what a `$META_VAR` matches, and later rules can only match the content captured by the first rule without modifying it.

Let's see an example. Suppose we want to find a recursive function in JavaScript. [This rule](https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html#eyJtb2RlIjoiQ29uZmlnIiwibGFuZyI6ImphdmFzY3JpcHQiLCJxdWVyeSI6ImZvbygkJCRBLCBiLCAkJCRDKSIsInJld3JpdGUiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOiJpZDogcmVjdXJzaXZlLWNhbGxcbmxhbmd1YWdlOiBKYXZhU2NyaXB0XG5ydWxlOlxuICBhbGw6XG4gIC0gcGF0dGVybjogZnVuY3Rpb24gJEYoKSB7ICQkJCB9XG4gIC0gaGFzOlxuICAgICAgcGF0dGVybjogJEYoKVxuICAgICAgc3RvcEJ5OiBlbmRcbiIsInNvdXJjZSI6ImZ1bmN0aW9uIHJlY3Vyc2UoKSB7XG4gICAgZm9vKClcbiAgICByZWN1cnNlKClcbn0ifQ==) can do the trick.

:::code-group

```yml [rule.yml]
id: recursive-call
language: JavaScript
rule:
  all:
  - pattern: function $F() { $$$ }
  - has:
      pattern: $F()
      stopBy: end
```

```js [match.js]
function recurse() {
  foo()
  recurse()
}
```
:::

The rule works because the pattern `function $F() { $$$ }` matches first, capturing `$F` as `recurse`. The later `has` rule then looks for a `recurse()` call based on the matched `$F`.

If we [swap the order of rules](https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html#eyJtb2RlIjoiQ29uZmlnIiwibGFuZyI6ImphdmFzY3JpcHQiLCJxdWVyeSI6ImZvbygkJCRBLCBiLCAkJCRDKSIsInJld3JpdGUiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOiJpZDogcmVjdXJzaXZlLWNhbGxcbmxhbmd1YWdlOiBKYXZhU2NyaXB0XG5ydWxlOlxuICBhbGw6XG4gIC0gaGFzOlxuICAgICAgcGF0dGVybjogJEYoKVxuICAgICAgc3RvcEJ5OiBlbmRcbiAgLSBwYXR0ZXJuOiBmdW5jdGlvbiAkRigpIHsgJCQkIH1cbiIsInNvdXJjZSI6ImZ1bmN0aW9uIHJlY3Vyc2UoKSB7XG4gICAgZm9vKClcbiAgICByZWN1cnNlKClcbn0ifQ==), it will produce no match.

```yml [rule.yml]
id: recursive-call
language: JavaScript
rule:
  all:
  - has:  # N.B. has is the first rule
      pattern: $F()
      stopBy: end
  - pattern: function $F() { $$$ }
```

In this case, the `has` rule matches first and captures `$F` as `foo` since `foo()` is the first function call matching the pattern `$F()`. The later rule `function $F() { $$$ }` will only find the `foo` declaration instead of `recurse`.

:::tip
Using `all` to specify the order of rule matching can be helpful when debugging YAML rules.

## What does unordered rule object imply?

A rule object in ast-grep is an unordered dictionary. The order of rule application is implementation-defined. Currently, ast-grep applies atomic rules first, then composite rules, and finally relational rules.

If your rule depends on using meta variables in later rules, the best way is to use the `all` rule to specify the order of rules.

## `kind` and `pattern` rules are not working together, why?

The most common scenario is that your pattern is parsed as a different AST node than you expected. And you may use `kind` rule to filter out the AST node you want to match. This does not work in ast-grep for two reasons:
1. tree-sitter, the underlying parser library, does not offer a way to parse a string of a specific kind. So `kind` rule cannot be used to change the parsing outcome of a `pattern`.
2. ast-grep rules are mostly independent of each other, except sharing meta-variables during a match. `pattern` will behave the same regardless of another `kind` rule.

To specify the `kind` of a `pattern`, you need to use [pattern](/guide/rule-config/atomic-rule.html#pattern-object) [object](/advanced/pattern-parse.html#incomplete-pattern-code).

For example, to match class field in JavaScript, a kind + pattern rule [will not work](/playground.html#eyJtb2RlIjoiQ29uZmlnIiwibGFuZyI6ImphdmFzY3JpcHQiLCJxdWVyeSI6IiIsInJld3JpdGUiOiIiLCJzdHJpY3RuZXNzIjoic21hcnQiLCJzZWxlY3RvciI6IiIsImNvbmZpZyI6InJ1bGU6XG4gIHBhdHRlcm46IGEgPSAxMjNcbiAga2luZDogZmllbGRfZGVmaW5pdGlvbiIsInNvdXJjZSI6ImNsYXNzIEEge1xuICAgIGEgPSAxMjNcbn0ifQ==):

```yaml
# these are two separate rules
pattern: a = 123          # rule 1
kind: field_definition    # rule 2
```

This is because pattern `a = 123` is parsed as [`assignment_expression`](/playground.html#eyJtb2RlIjoiUGF0Y2giLCJsYW5nIjoiamF2YXNjcmlwdCIsInF1ZXJ5IjoiYSA9IDEyMyIsInJld3JpdGUiOiIiLCJzdHJpY3RuZXNzIjoic21hcnQiLCJzZWxlY3RvciI6IiIsImNvbmZpZyI6IiIsInNvdXJjZSI6IiJ9). Pattern and kind are two separate rules. And using them together will match nothing because no AST will have both `assignment_expression` and `field_definition` kind at once.

Instead, you need to use pattern object to provide enough context code for the parser to parse the code snippet as `field_definition`:

```yaml
# this is one single pattern rule!
pattern:
  context: 'class A { a = 123 }' # provide full context code
  selector: field_definition     # select the effective pattern
```

Note the rule above is one single pattern rule, instead of two. The `context` field provides the full unambiguous code snippet of `class`. So the `a = 123` will be parsed as `field_definition`. The `selector` field then selects the `field_definition` node as the [effective pattern](/advanced/pattern-parse.html#steps-to-create-a-pattern) matcher.

## Does ast-grep support some advanced static analysis?

Short answer: **NO**.

Long answer: ast-grep at the moment does not support the following information:
* [scope analysis](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/scope-manager-interface)
* [type information](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/pattern-syntax#typed-metavariables)
* [control flow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_analysis)
* [data flow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis)
* [taint analysis](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/data-flow/taint-mode)
* [constant propagation](https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/data-flow/constant-propagation)

More concretely, it is not easy, or even possible, to achieve the following tasks in ast-grep:

* Find variables that are not defined/used in the current scope.
* Find variables of a specific type.
* Find code that is unreachable.
* Find code that is always executed.
* Identify the flow of user input.

Also see [tool comparison](/advanced/tool-comparison.html) for more information.
