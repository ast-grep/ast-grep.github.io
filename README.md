## ast-grep(sg)

ast-grep(sg) is a lightning fast and user friendly tool for code searching, linting, rewriting at large scale.

This is the website source for ast-grep!

## Setup Guide

Unfortunately wasm-pack does not support compiling C dependency with stdlib.
~~We have to use emcc.~~

We have to use web-tree-sitter

To setup:

1. Install wasm-pack https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/, pnpm, cargo
2. Clone the repo
3. `wasm-pack build --target web`. This will build the wasm in `pkg` folder
4. `pnpm install`
5. `pnpm dev`
6. visit localhost:5173. This will make vitepress cache the dependency.
7. Run the following script, which is needed for dev-time wasm bundling:
   ```sh
   cd website/.vitepress/cache/deps
   ln -s ../../../../pkg/ast_grep_wasm_bg.wasm
   cd ../../../..
   ```

---

emcc setup is not used any more

~~

1. Install [emcc](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
2. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten`
3. cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli
4. EMCC_CFLAGS="-s ERROR_ON_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS=0 --no-entry" cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-emscripten
5. wasm-bindgen --target web ../../target/wasm32-unknown-emscripten/debug/ast_grep_wasm.wasm --out-dir pkg

## ast-grep playground

## Pre-requisite

It requires tree-sitter.wasm and tree-sitter-{lang}.wasm available in public directory.

Language specific wasm must be built with the same emcc version of the tree-sitter.wasm.

Mismatching emcc version will raise RuntimeError.
